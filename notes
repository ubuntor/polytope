consider combining functions
f:R^2 -> R, g:R^2 -> R
as h(x,y,z,w) = f(x,y) + g(z,w)
to get more dimensions

subdivide simplex and transform?
    loop subdivision???
ooh http://www.immagery.com/pdf/cage_based_def_methods.pdf

orchestral samples?

while True:
    sort vertices by value
    reflect/expand/contract worst vertex
    shrink if no candidate vertex found

[reflect] [expand] [contract/shrink?]
hmm https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~fuchang/res/ANMS.pdf

assign barycentric coordinates, then use as transform!
    might need to precalculate
